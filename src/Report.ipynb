    "Instrument detection is a cornerstone in music information retrieval (MIR). In this notebook, we will explore the task of instrument detection and train varying models. We will follow the method of [Predominant Musical Instrument Classification based on Spectral Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02606.pdf) (MIC) by Racharla et al. (2020). The dataset used in this notebook is the [OpenMIC-2018](http://ismir2018.ircam.fr/doc/pdfs/248_Paper.pdf), a crowd-sourced dataset of 20,000 audio files with 10-second clips of 20 different instruments, sponsored by Spotify and New York Univiversity's MARL and Center for Data Science. The dataset is available on [paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/openmic-2018). They also have a [github repo](https://github.com/cosmir/openmic-2018) with the dataset and [modelling baseline code](https://github.com/cosmir/openmic-2018/blob/master/examples/modeling-baseline.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenMIC-2018 dataset were chosen before we understood the limitations of the dataset, and so, our final model and analysis will have some limitations. The comparions with MIC are not going to be fair, which is furthered discussed in later sections. All together, it has been a great learning experience.\n",

The OpenMIC-2018 dataset consists of 20 000 audio samples, but not all of them have human annotations.

It was a bit cumbersome to understand the design of the dataset, but the modelling baseline was really helpful. The dataset comes with a predefined `.npz` file.

It is hard to tell which model is the better, but we can see that piano, voice and guitar does well over all models. Trumpet and organ does not do as well, and flute is the worst performing instrument. Compared to MICs table, there is a lot of variation in the results. Piano is doing much better than MIC, something which could be the result of many potential factors. First, having a predominant instrument per sound file, and having multiple instruments per sound file, might make a big difference for their suggested approach. To get to the bottom of this, we would need to do a more in-depth analysis of the data, which is outside the scope of this project. Second, it could be a sign of overfitting.\n",

The most time-consuming part was understanding the differences between OpenMIC-2018 and IRMAS, which to some extent took its toll on the quality of our analysis. The absolute goal of this project is to pass DT2470 Music Informatics, and we believe we have achieved what we set out to do in the beginning of the project. Going forward, it would be interesting to see if we can improve the results. We have a few ideas:\n",
